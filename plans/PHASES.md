# DealFlow360 phase index

Each phase is intentionally small enough for one focused agent run. Do phases
in order unless this file explicitly states otherwise. “Planned” means no agent
has completed it yet; its phase file records the present baseline so future
agents do not need to infer it.

Before starting any phase, apply the protocol in [README.md](README.md). The
frontend should use [../docs/FRONTEND_API.md](../docs/FRONTEND_API.md), not the
phase files, as its API guide.
